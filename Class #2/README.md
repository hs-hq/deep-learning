# Deep Learning Applied to Image Recognition

[The keynote covered](http://www.meetup.com/Holberton-School/events/230547621/) applications of Deep Learning to images, a domain which has seen amazing progress in the past few years.

The students and attendees have:

* Walked through the structure of a Convolutional Neural Network and form an intuition of what makes it tick.
* Ran a simple model that classifies hand-written digits.
* Ran a more elaborate model that classifies a larger set of images.

The keynote was given by [Louis Monier](https://twitter.com/louis_monier) and workshop by [Gregory Renard](https://twitter.com/Redo).

For this workshop, Gregory Renard commented in detail:
* [mnist](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/holbertonschool/deep-learning/blob/master/Class%20%232/mnist_cnn.html) - Convolutional Neural Networks code recognizing digits
* [CIFAR10](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/holbertonschool/deep-learning/blob/master/Class%20%232/Cifar%2010%20CNN.html) - Convolutional Neural Networks code recognizing airplane, automobile, bird, cat...

To get started with Deep Learning by using a pre-installed/configured machine, follor our [Vagrant machine tutorial here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/deep-learning-vagrant-machine).

Once in the Vagrant machine is up and you are connected to it, go into `keras/examples/` and run your CNN by running:
* `python mnist_cnn.py`
* `python cifar10_cnn.py`
