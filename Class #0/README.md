# Deep Learning Introduction with ConvNetJS at Holberton School

Deep Learning Introduction by Louis Monier and Gregory Renard.

## Introduction

The goals of these exercices are 
- to play with your first Neural Networks based on the Javascript implementation of Neural networks by Andrej Karpathy : "ConvNetJS".
- to develop your intuition about Neural Network and observe how their structure and hyper-paramaters impact the learning curve.

ConvNetJS is a Javascript library for training Deep Learning models (mainly Neural Networks) entirely in your browser. 
Open a tab and you're training. No software requirements, no compilers, no installation, no GPUs, no sweat!

It comes with nice browser-based demos, and was originally developed by Andrej Karpathy at [Stanford](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/).  
The original project is at https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs

## Demos Guidelines & RoadMap
